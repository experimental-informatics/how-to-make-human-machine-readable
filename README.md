### Description

The generation of text by means of deep neural nets (NLG) has spread rapidly. Among other things, text-based dialog systems such as chatbots, assistance systems (Alexa/Siri) or robot journalism are increasingly used in news portals, e-commerce and social media; wherever context-based, natural language or reader-friendly texts are to be generated from structured data. Deep writing techniques have also found their way into the arts and literature with the help of models such as ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or GPT-2/3 (Generative Pre-Training Transformer).

The goal of the seminar is that at the end each student has produced (a) text based on one of the neural language models mentioned above. No matter if poem, prose, novella, essay, manifesto, shopping list or social bot.

The course is intended as a general introduction to programming. It will not only teach skills to generate texts, but also the basics of Python, a universal programming language that can be used to program images, PDFs or web applications. Furthermore, Python is the most widely used language in programming Artificial Intelligences, especially Deep Neural Nets.

We ask for registration at [ground-zero@khm.de](mailto:ground-zero@khm.de) until 20.09.2021. No prior knowledge of programming is required to participate in the basic seminar.
